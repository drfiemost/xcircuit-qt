Xcircuit v3.x  Things To Do (file TODO)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs to fix:

1) Positional parameters cause incorrect redisplay during polygon/path
  edit (display reverts to original value).  Insertion of points must
  renumber parameterized points.

2) Position parameters have serious consequences for netlisting, in
  that they can cause an object's netlist to change on a per-instance
  basis.  This should be either dealt with or prevented.

3) Substring selection in labels is backwards when the "flip
  invariance" feature has rotated the text string 180 degrees.

4) Colormap installation may be incomplete if xcircuit runs out
  of colors in the middle of running the program (minor problem;
  unlikely to happen).

5) Color and Page menus run off the top and bottom of the screen
  if the lists get to be too long.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Features to add or change:

1) Multiple item simultaneous edit:  If "edit" is invoked when multiple
   elements are selected, and all elements are "similar" (e.g., exactly
   the same except for spatial translation), then the edit is simultaneously
   applied to all the elements.  This is particularly useful for adjusting
   the endpoints of multiple lines, as in a table or graph.

2) Instance numeric parameter edit:  If "edit" is invoked on an instance,
   then the element inside that instance that is closest to the pointer
   position and  has a numerically parameterized point or other
   parameterized property (e.g., radius) will be put into edit mode.
   Parameterized positions of instances and labels should invoke "move"
   mode.  Both modes (edit and move) should be constrained to one axis
   if only one dimension is parameterized.

3) Graphic element, still to be addressed:

    A) Incorporate raw PostScript by using ghostscript to generate
       PPM data, and handling it like a PPM file, but treating it
       in file input/output as an encapsulated PostScript block.
       This should replace the current background rendering code.

    B) Rewrite the image processing routines to clip the size of
       the target image when outside screen bounds.  Cropped
       images must be declared invalid on pan operations.

    C) Page saves for backup should not write the graphic image,
       or at least should not write it more than once (write it
       to a separate file?)

4) Create a Tcl command to return the value of countchanges(), and make
   "quitcheck" a Tcl script, avoiding all the Tcl_Eval() calls there.

5) Allow page label to be changed from the label on the bottom message bar.

6) Some better handling of over/under arrangements of elements

7) Vectored font output in PostScript.

8) Proper cornering on dot/dashed boxes (maybe easier to
   do in xcircuit and enforce WYSIWYG in PostScript?)

9) Switch to all-floating-point internal units? ---probably not
   necessary, but converting all XPoints to structures with ints
   would be helpful.

10) Comprehensive dependency list for allowing/disallowing
   menu functions (key function dependencies have been dealt
   with).

11) Page indices need to be separated from the pagelist indices, so
   that schematic library objects can be loaded and manipulated
   without having to be displayed in the page list. 

12) Need to translate the Python routines for handling the "generic"
   netlist output to Tcl.
